# GuessNumberGame
It is a number game / magic trick in layman terms. This project demonstrates use of java AWT, servlets, session handling and apache tomcat.

This game is developed in two versions. 
1. One is a desktop application developed using java AWT and event listeners. This is developed in jre8 environment (use of lambda expressions).
2. Another is web application developed using servlets. There are 4 types of session tracking: hidden form fields, URL rewriting, cookies and session tracking using servlet api. Each type of session tracking is demonstrated in different folders as shown.

Working:
1. One has to choose a number between 0 to 63 in his/her mind. 
2. Now, he/ she has to answer some yes-no questions. These questions mainly display list of random numbers and one has to answer whether his/her number is present in the list or not.
3. By answering series of these questions, finally the user's number is displayed on the screen. 
And congrats!! The magic trick just completed.

Procedure to run:
1. To run the desktop application run MainMagic class.
2. To run the servlet based web application I have used Apache Tomcat.
